    <h1>New Parvo Treatment Offers Hope for Sick Puppies</h1>
    <p>About the Canine Parvo Monoclonal Antibody - Updated on September 26, 2023</p>
    <img width="100%" src="images/blog/news-1.webp" alt="">
    <p>
      In May 2023, the USDA granted a conditional license for a groundbreaking new treatment to treat canine parvovirus, a
      highly contagious and sometimes fatal disease. The Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody, developed by Elanco, is a
      one-time injection that has been shown to increase survival rates and reduce the length of hospital stays in dogs with
      the disease. Until now, there has been no specific treatment for parvovirus.
    </p>
    <h2>What Is Parvovirus?</h2>
    <p>Parvo is a highly contagious virus that primarily affects puppies. The virus causes immune system suppression,
    gastrointestinal distress, and sometimes heart damage. Dogs experience severe diarrhea, lethargy, vomiting, and loss of
    appetite. Parvo damages the lining of the intestines, preventing the absorption of nutrients and water.
    
    Elanco veterinarian Jennifer Miller, DVM tells Daily Paws that an estimated 330,000 cases of canine parvovirus are
    diagnosed annually in the United States. “Parvo is a devastating disease that affects all areas of veterinary medicine.
    Vets still see outbreaks despite the availability of a vaccine.”
    
    Sadly, some puppies don’t survive parvo despite excellent supportive care. And Miller states that, without supportive
    care, there’s a 91 percent mortality rate.</p>
    <h2>How Does the New Treatment Work?</h2>
    <p>The Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody works by stopping parvovirus directly. “It binds to the virus and stops it
    from adhering to the gut cells so it cannot replicate,” Miller says. The one-time intravenous injection is administered
    after a positive parvo diagnosis. Most patients will still be treated with supportive care, which typically involves
    hospitalization, fluid therapy, and various medications to manage symptoms.</p>

    <h2>Cookie’s Success Story</h2>
    <p>In July 2023, an 8-week-old pit bull mix named Cookie, who had not received any previous vaccinations, was brought to
    The Fix Project's Parvo ICU by her owner. She was displaying parvo symptoms, and a test confirmed the diagnosis. Within
    30 minutes, Cookie received Elanco's Monoclonal Antibody and was admitted to the ICU for supportive care.</p>

    <p>
      Andrew Cabrera, DVM of the Fix Project tells Daily Paws that Cookie was small, and he was worried about losing her.
      However, she showed significant improvement by the second day and was eating normally by the third day. Just five days
      after diagnosis, Cookie was able to return home with her family, fully recovered from parvovirus.
    </p>
    <img width="100%" src="images/blog/news-3.webp" alt="">
    <p>
      Cookie made history as the first puppy to be treated with Elanco's Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody, and she wasn’t
      the last. Cabrera says he has seen similar results in other parvo puppies he has treated.
      
      “The success rate has been night and day,” Cabrera says. “We’re able to get them eating a little faster and out of the
      hospital a little more quickly.”
      
      Cabrera adds that the treatment has improved the veterinary team’s stress levels and workload. Parvo patients require
      around-the-clock care, and team members develop strong bonds with their patients. It’s difficult to watch some puppies
      decline in spite of treatment. But Cabrera says that Elanco’s Monoclonal Antibody has significantly improved their
      success rate. Almost every single pup who received the treatment survived.
      
      Miller anticipates vets across the country will add Elanco’s Monoclonal Antibody into current parvo protocols to reduce
      hospitalization time and increase the odds of survival.
